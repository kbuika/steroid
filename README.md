# steroid

A CLI to scaffold your favourite Javascript Framework with build tools, templates, styling and linting configurations ready to go

## Getting started

After cloning the project and installing dependencies, ideally with `pnpm`,

- Run `pnpm dev` to compile the Typescript code.

- Run `pnpm link-cli` - this will unlink and link the project `./dist/index.js` to your global package bin directory

- You can now run `steroid` in your terminal. If this does not work and you are not on windows, try the `pnpm sudo-link-cli` command or the `pnpm chmod-cli`

If your issues persist goodluck explaining that to ChatGPT or Gemini
